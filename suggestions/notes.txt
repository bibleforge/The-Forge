Questions:
What about divine words?

Two word phrases should be removed if just the first word is unique.
	E.g., "Jehozabad" has 4 results and "Jehozabad the" has 1.  "Jehozabad the" is not needed.
	Should we get rid of the single word phase?

The last word in the English Bible is a complete sentence, so we don't know if the phrase script would correctly get phrases at the end for other languages.
